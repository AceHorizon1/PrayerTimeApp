        summary="Monochrome icon is not defined"
        explanation="If `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` are both in your manifest, you must either remove the reference to `android:roundIcon` if it is not needed; or, supply the monochrome icon in the drawable defined by the `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` attribute.&#xA;&#xA;For example, if `android:roundIcon` and `android:icon` are both in the manifest, a launcher might choose to use `android:roundIcon` over `android:icon` to display the adaptive app icon. Therefore, your themed application iconwill not show if your monochrome attribute is not also specified in `android:roundIcon`."
